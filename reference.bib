	abstract = {When permutation methods are used in practice, often a limited number of random permutations are used to decrease the computational burden. However, most theoretical literature assumes that the whole permutation group is used, and methods based on random permutations tend to be seen as approximate. There exists a very limited amount of literature on exact testing with random permutations, and only recently a thorough proof of exactness was given. In this paper, we provide an alternative proof, viewing the test as a “conditional Monte Carlo test” as it has been called in the literature. We also provide extensions of the result. Importantly, our results can be used to prove properties of various multiple testing procedures based on random permutations.},

	abstract = {Randomized Aggregatable Privacy-Preserving Ordinal Response, or RAPPOR, is a technology for crowdsourcing statistics from end-user client software, anonymously, with strong privacy guarantees. In short, RAPPORs allow the forest of client data to be studied, without permitting the possibility of looking at individual trees. By applying randomized response in a novel manner, RAPPOR provides the mechanisms for such collection as well as for efficient, high-utility analysis of the collected data. In particular, RAPPOR permits statistics to be collected on the population of client-side strings with strong privacy guarantees for each client, and without linkability of their reports. This paper describes and motivates RAPPOR, details its differential-privacy and utility guarantees, discusses its practical deployment and properties in the face of different attack models, and, finally, gives results of its application to both synthetic and real-world data.},

To resolve these issues, we introduce a family of U-statistics for multinomial goodness-of-fit and study their asymptotic behaviors in high-dimensions. Specifically, we establish conditions under which the considered U-statistic is asymptotically Poisson or Gaussian, and investigate its power function under each asymptotic regime. Furthermore, we introduce a class of weights for the U-statistic that results in minimax rate optimal tests.},

The topics are organized from the central idea of approximation by limit experiments, which gives the book one of its unifying themes. This entails mainly the local approximation of the classical i.i.d. set up with smooth parameters by location experiments involving a single, normally distributed observation. Thus, even the standard subjects of asymptotic statistics are presented in a novel way. Suitable as a graduate or Master's level statistics text, this book will also give researchers an overview of research in asymptotic statistics.},

We show that this discrete distribution on integers shares many properties of the classical Laplace distribution on the real line, including unimodality, infinite divisibility, closure properties with respect to geometric compounding, and a maximum entropy property.

	abstract = {We study the role that privacy-preserving algorithms, which prevent the leakage of specific information about participants, can play in the design of mechanisms for strategic agents, which must encourage players to honestly report information. Specifically, we show that the recent notion of differential privacv, in addition to its own intrinsic virtue, can ensure that participants have limited effect on the outcome of the mechanism, and as a consequence have limited incentive to lie. More precisely, mechanisms with differential privacy are approximate dominant strategy under arbitrary player utility functions, are automatically resilient to coalitions, and easily allow repeatability. We study several special cases of the unlimited supply auction problem, providing new results for digital goods auctions, attribute auctions, and auctions with arbitrary structural constraints on the prices. As an important prelude to developing a privacy-preserving auction mechanism, we introduce and study a generalization of previous privacy work that accommodates the high sensitivity of the auction setting, where a single participant may dramatically alter the optimal fixed price, and a slight change in the offered price may take the revenue from optimal to zero.},

   abstract = {An applied treatment of the key methods and state-of-the-art tools for visualizing and understanding statistical data Smoothing of Multivariate Data provides an illustrative and hands-on approach to the multivariate aspects of density estimation, emphasizing the use of visualization tools. Rather than outlining the theoretical concepts of classification and regression, this book focuses on the procedures for estimating a multivariate distribution via smoothing. The author first provides an introduction to various visualization tools that can be used to construct representations of multivariate functions, sets, data, and scales of multivariate density estimates. Next, readers are presented with an extensive review of the basic mathematical tools that are needed to asymptotically analyze the behavior of multivariate density estimators, with coverage of density classes, lower bounds, empirical processes, and manipulation of density estimates. The book concludes with an extensive toolbox of multivariate density estimators, including anisotropic kernel estimators, minimization estimators, multivariate adaptive histograms, and wavelet estimators. A completely interactive experience is encouraged, as all examples and figurescan be easily replicated using the R software package, and every chapter concludes with numerous exercises that allow readers to test their understanding of the presented techniques. The R software is freely available on the book's related Web site along with "Code" sections for each chapter that provide short instructions for working in the R environment. Combining mathematical analysis with practical implementations, Smoothing of Multivariate Data is an excellent book for courses in multivariate analysis, data analysis, and nonparametric statistics at the upper-undergraduate and graduatelevels. It also serves as a valuable reference for practitioners and researchers in the fields of statistics, computer science, economics, and engineering.},

An estimator of the functional component that is adaptive over the wide range of multivariate Besov classes and robust to a wide choice of distributions of the linear component and random errors is constructed. It is also shown that the same estimator is locally adaptive over the same range of Besov classes and robust over large collections of distributions of the linear component and random errors as well.

	abstract = {Permutation tests are widely used in statistics, providing a finite-sample guarantee on the type I error rate whenever the distribution of the samples under the null hypothesis is invariant to some rearrangement. Despite its increasing popularity and empirical success, theoretical properties of the permutation test, especially its power, have not been fully explored beyond simple cases. In this paper, we attempt to partly fill this gap by presenting a general nonasymptotic framework for analyzing the minimax power of the permutation test. The utility of our proposed framework is illustrated in the context of two-sample and independence testing under both discrete and continuous settings. In each setting, we introduce permutation tests based on U-statistics and study their minimax performance. We also develop exponential concentration bounds for permuted U-statistics based on a novel coupling idea, which may be of independent interest. Building on these exponential bounds, we introduce permutation tests, which are adaptive to unknown smoothness parameters without losing much power. The proposed framework is further illustrated using more sophisticated test statistics including weighted U-statistics for multinomial testing and Gaussian kernel-based statistics for density testing. Finally, we provide some simulation results that further justify the permutation approach.},

While the problems have a long history in statistics, finite sample bounds for these problems have only been established recently. In this work, we derive upper and lower bounds on the sample complexity of both the problems under (ε, δ)-differential privacy. We provide sample optimal algorithms for identity testing problem for all parameter ranges, and the first results for closeness testing. Our closeness testing bounds are optimal in the sparse regime where the number of samples is at most k.Our upper bounds are obtained by privatizing non-private estimators for these problems. The non-private estimators are chosen to have small sensitivity. We propose a general framework to establish lower bounds on the sample complexity of statistical tasks under differential privacy. We show a bound on differentially private algorithms in terms of a coupling between the two hypothesis classes we aim to test. By carefully constructing chosen priors over the hypothesis classes, and using Le Cam's two point theorem we provide a general mechanism for proving lower bounds. We believe that the framework can be used to obtain strong lower bounds for other statistical tasks under privacy.},

   abstract = {The collection and analysis of telemetry data from user's devices is routinely performed by many software companies. Telemetry collection leads to improved user experience but poses significant risks to users' privacy. Locally differentially private (LDP) algorithms have recently emerged as the main tool that allows data collectors to estimate various population statistics, while preserving privacy. The guarantees provided by such algorithms are typically very strong for a single round of telemetry collection, but degrade rapidly when telemetry is collected regularly. In particular, existing LDP algorithms are not suitable for repeated collection of counter data such as daily app usage statistics. In this paper, we develop new LDP mechanisms geared towards repeated collection of counter data, with formal privacy guarantees even after being executed for an arbitrarily long period of time. For two basic analytical tasks, mean estimation and histogram estimation, our LDP mechanisms for repeated data collection provide estimates with comparable or even the same accuracy as existing single-round LDP collection mechanisms. We conduct empirical evaluation on real-world counter datasets to verify our theoretical results. Our mechanisms have been deployed by Microsoft to collect telemetry across millions of devices.},

First, we study the general framework of mapping each user’s type into a signal and show that the problem of finding the maximum-likelihood distribution over the signals is feasible. Then we discuss the randomized-response mechanism and show that, in essence, it maps the null- and alternative-hypotheses onto new sets, an affine translation of the original sets. We then give sample complexity bounds for identity and independence testing under randomized-response. We then move to the newer non-symmetric mechanisms and show that there too the problem of finding the maximum-likelihood distribution is feasible. Under the mechanism of Bassily et al we give identity and independence testers with better sample complexity than the testers in the symmetric case, and we also propose a χ^2-based identity tester which we investigate empirically.},

Compared to existing output perturbation mechanisms, our mechanism improves the dominated term of the type-II error from O(1) to O((-N)) where N is the sample size. Furthermore, we introduce novel procedures for multiple χ^2 tests by incorporating the unit circle mechanism into the sparse vector technique and the exponential mechanism. These procedures can control the family-wise error rate (FWER) properly, which has never been attained by existing mechanisms.},

The class of U-statistics covers many statistical estimates of interest, including Gini mean difference, Kendall’s tau coefficient and Area under the ROC Curve (AUC), as well as empirical risk measures for machine learning problems such as ranking, clustering and metric learning. We first introduce an LDP protocol based on quantizing the data into bins and applying randomized response, which guarantees an ε-LDP estimate with a Mean Squared Error (MSE) of O(1/nε) under regularity assumptions on the U-statistic or the data distribution. We then propose a specialized protocol for AUC based on a novel use of hierarchical histograms that achieves MSE of O(α^3/nε^2) for arbitrary data distribution. We also show that 2-party secure computation allows to design a protocol with MSE of O(1/nε^2), without any assumption on the kernel function or data distribution and with total communication linear in the number of users n. Finally, we evaluate the performance of our protocols through experiments on synthetic and real datasets.},

    abstract = {Hypothesis tests are a crucial statistical tool for data mining and are the workhorse of scientific research in many fields. Here we study differentially private tests of independence between a categorical and a continuous variable. We take as our starting point traditional nonparametric tests, which require no distributional assumption (e.g., normality) about the data distribution. We present private analogues of the Kruskal-Wallis, Mann-Whitney, and Wilcoxon signed-rank tests, as well as the parametric one-sample t-test. These tests use novel test statistics developed specifically for the private setting. We compare our tests to prior work, both on parametric and nonparametric tests. We find that in all cases our new nonparametric tests achieve large improvements in statistical power, even when the assumptions of parametric tests are met.},

The complexity of the data and models makes this a challenge; methods to protect privacy further complicate the issue. We demonstrate how to estimate statistical significance of results in the context of a social network analysis problem; the impact of the noise required to provide differential privacy is included in the significance measure. As a result, providing privacy does not complicate the use of the analysis. While demonstrated for social network analysis, the approach is general. The Wilcoxon signed-rank test used is appropriate for a wide variety of data with “before” and “after” measurements, and adapts well to differential privacy. We demonstrate on publicly available data with known privacy issues, showing that some apparently large differences are not significant, some small differences are, and that when the analysis is done using differential privacy, the same results can been achieved while protecting individual privacy. },

abstract = {A mechanism for releasing information about a statistical database with sensitive data must resolve a trade-off between utility and privacy. Publishing fully accurate information maximizes utility while minimizing privacy, while publishing random noise accomplishes the opposite. Privacy can be rigorously quantified using the framework of differential privacy, which requires that a mechanism's output distribution is nearly the same whether or not a given database row is included or excluded. The goal of this paper is strong and general utility guarantees, subject to differential privacy. We pursue mechanisms that guarantee near-optimal utility to every potential user, independent of its side information (modeled as a prior distribution over query results) and preferences (modeled via a loss function). Our main result is: for each fixed count query and differential privacy level, there is a geometric mechanism M* -- a discrete variant of the simple and well-studied Laplace mechanism -- that is simultaneously expected loss-minimizing for every possible user, subject to the differential privacy constraint. This is an extremely strong utility guarantee: every potential user u, no matter what its side information and preferences, derives as much utility from M* as from interacting with a differentially private mechanism Mu that is optimally tailored to u. More precisely, for every user u there is an optimal mechanism Mu for it that factors into a user-independent part (the geometric mechanism M*) followed by user-specific post-processing that can be delegated to the user itself. The first part of our proof of this result characterizes the optimal differentially private mechanism for a fixed but arbitrary user in terms of a certain basic feasible solution to a linear program with constraints that encode differential privacy. The second part shows that all of the relevant vertices of this polytope (ranging over all possible users) are derivable from the geometric mechanism via suitable remappings of its range.},
